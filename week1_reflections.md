# What I Learned This Week:

1. Highlevel introduction to the different data structures we will be covering this semester: 
    1. Record
    2. Array
    3. Linked List
    4. Binary Tree
    5. Hash Table
    6. Heap
    7. Graph

2. NP-complete algorithms do not have swift solutions/it is if it's even possible to find a fast solution for them

3. Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and their underlying data structures

ADT | Description | Common Underlying DS
--- | --- | ---
List | Holds ordered data | Array, Linked List
Dynamic Array | Holds ordered data and allows indexed access | Array
Stack | Items are only inserted on or removed from the top of a stack | Linked List
Queue | Items are inserted at the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue | Linked List
Set | For collection of distinct items | Binary Search Tree, Hash Table
