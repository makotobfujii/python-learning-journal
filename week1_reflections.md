# What I Learned This Week:

1. Highlevel introduction to the different data structures we will be covering this semester: 
Data Structure | Description 
--- | ---
Record | Stores subitems, often called fields, with a name associated with each subitem
Array | Stores an ordered list of items, where each item is directly accessible by a positional index
Linked List | Stores an ordered list of items in nodes, where each node stores data and has a pointer to the next node
Binary Tree | Each node stores data and has up to two children known as a left child and a right child 
Hash Table | Stores unordered items by mapping (or hashing) each item to a location in an array
Heap | A **max-heap** is a tree that maintains the simple property that a node's key is greater than or equal to the node's childrens' key. A **min-heap** is a tree that maintains the simple property that a node's key is less than or equal to the node's childrens' keys
Graph | Represents connections among items, and consiss of vertices connected by edges. A **vertex** represents an item in a graph. An **edge** represents a connection between two vertices in a graph

2. NP-complete algorithms do not have swift solutions/it is unconfirmed if it's even possible to find a fast solution for them

3. Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and their underlying data structures

ADT | Description | Common Underlying DS
--- | --- | ---
List | Holds ordered data | Array, Linked List
Dynamic Array | Holds ordered data and allows indexed access | Array
Stack | Items are only inserted on or removed from the top of a stack | Linked List
Queue | Items are inserted at the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue | Linked List
Set | For collection of distinct items | Binary Search Tree, Hash Table
