# About Me
Hi my name is Makoto and I am a novice programmer. 
Most of my experience with python programming comes in the form of data analysis through Pandas and some light GUI work through tkinter. 
While I have utilized APIs to analyze data, there is much to learn when it comes to more advanced programming.

# Goals for This Course
My goals for this class include:

1. Obtaining a better understanding of data structures
2. Further build my algorithmic thinking skills
3. Make basic level python programming second nature OOP, GUI, File manipulation etc

# My First Python Program
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
